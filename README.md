# Raytracer-WASM
## About
A raytracer I made in rust for the web. If you use it I suggest you check the box marked rust, as halfway through I decided to switch to rust and wasm and didn't update the js version of the raytracer. So the js version has no shadows and slightly different settings.
## Build
```
wasm-pack build --release --target web
```
## Demo
